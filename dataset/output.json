kept his eyes closed and remained limp during most of his hearing requiring sheriffs deputies to hold him up he district attorney called his courtroom behavior very bizarre his defendant has engaged in a protracted campaign in which he has set the people believe upwards of 52 arson fires in what essentially amounts to a campaign of terror against this community os ngeles ounty eputy istrict

incendiary devices placed under their engines he criminal complaint filed ednesday also alleged that the fires were caused by use of a device designed to accelerate the fire ooley said f found true the allegation could mean additional custody time for the defendant n numerous instances the cars were parked in carports resulting in the fires spreading to the adjacent occupied apartment buildings

woman is wanted on 16 counts of fraud and three counts of embezzlement he said he charges include an allegation that she failed to pay for a breast enhancement operation performed on her in 2004 eilinger said ost of the erman charges however stem from phony real estate deals that orothee urkhart allegedly conducted between 2000 and 2006 t is my opinion that the defendants criminal spree was motivated by his rage against mericans and that by setting these fires the defendant intended to harm and terrorize as many residents of the city and county of os ngeles as possible ordskog wrote  search of urkharts ollywood apartment found newspaper clippings about the os ngeles fires and articles from ermany reporting similar car fires in rankfurt ermany in eptember 2011 the investigator said
